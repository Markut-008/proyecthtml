  		<p>Hi, i live in Santiago, chile.I am a student of the Duoc institute, and through this I was able to find out about the existence of Coursera.</p>
		<p> I took that course because of the opportunity it gave me to study this field, and it didn't complicate me as much as I thought it would, the only complicated thing was that everything is in English.</p>
